# Contributing

We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible. All contributions
are welcome.

## Code of Conduct

The code of conduct is described in [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Please ensure your description is clear and has
sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce the issue.

## Commit Messages

"Re-establishing the context of a piece of code is wasteful. We can't avoid it completely, so our
efforts should go to reducing it \[as much\] as possible. Commit messages can do exactly that and as
a result, a *commit message shows whether a developer is a good collaborator*." -- Peter Hutterer

The seven rules of a great git commit message:

1. separate subject from body with a blank line;
2. limit the subject line to 50 characters;
3. capitalise the subject line;
4. do not end the subject line with a period;
5. use the imperative mood in the subject line;
6. wrap the body at 72 characters;
7. use the body to explain _what_ and _why_ vs. _how_.

See [How to Write a Git Commit Message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams.

## Issue References

GitHub issue numbers should be referenced on the last line of the commit message. Keywords can be
used to [automatically close
issues](https://help.github.com/en/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords). For example:

```

## Pull Requests

We actively welcome your pull requests.

1. fork the repo and create your branch from `master`;
2. follow coding style and best practice;
3. add unit-test coverage where possible;
4. ensure the test suite passes;
5. ensure that there are no package cycles;
6. update the documentation for API changes;
7. run checkstyle and format your changes.

### Assertions

Use `assert` statements to formalise contract and document assumptions.

### Logging

Long running applications and services should log exceptional conditions and life-cycle events.
Logging in library code, where the run-time context is often unknown, is generally frowned upon and
should be kept to a minimum. Log files should be kept clean and readable; they should not be used to
trace the normal flow of execution in production code.
